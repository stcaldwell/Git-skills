<h1>Sam Caldwell</h1>
<p>I am from Greensboro, NC.I was working at Duke University in the Economics Department before starting to learn programming. I chose coding because I wanted to take on a new challenge and learn a valuable skill.</p>
<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
<p>I would like to learn Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and Java for sure. I may want to check some others out as well but those three for sure.</p>
